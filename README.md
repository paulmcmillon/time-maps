<H3>Support and Upgrade Roadmap Overview</H3>

<p>
  This document outlines the proposed phases and steps to upgrade the architecture, technology stack and user interface for the following reasons, among others, and the basic solution support to be provided by        Softeknology, Inc.  Here are some of the objectives of this project.

  <ul>
    
    • Modernize Overall Solution    
    • Ensure Application Resiliency    
    • Implement Auto Scaling in Solution
    • Enhance Data and Application Security
    • Promote Source Code Maintainability
    • Introduce User-Friendly Interface
    • New user-friendly interface
    • Decrease Operational Cost
  
  </ul>

Implementing  [Cloud-Native](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition) and [Microservice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/) 
architectures and principles we can achieve these objectives as well as many others.  Adopting Microsoft Azure, C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and Blazor also help address many of these concerns.
</p>

<H3>Support Plan</H3>

<p>
  The application is Currently supported via email request.  Maintenance and application issues are being neglected.  Softeknology, Inc proposes to assume the ongoing responsibility of supporting email requests as    well as any other client/customer concerns either by email or directly by phone.  Softeknology, Inc. will also assume responsibility for addressing any current application issues.
</p>

<p>
  Softeknology, Inc. will create a cloud-based source code repository for the current code base and conduct a comprehensive review of the user interface to document any current issues with the application.  Using     Azure DevOps and GitHub will achieve the following goals:

  <ul>

    • Ensure ongoing customer and application support.
    • Deliver a stable application to customers.
    • Provide a secure source code repository accessible from anywhere with internet access.
    • Furnish a repsoitory for documenting and backlogging any current application issues.
    • Serve as a management tool for mitigating and reporting current application issues.

  </ul>

  Utilizing these same tools, a separate project will be set up for the upgrade project to keep new source code and project backlog items separate from the existing code base.
</p>

<H3>Upgrade Plan</H3>

<p>
  Because an abundance of data and source code currently exists, as opposed to a complete re-engineering of the application all at once, a multi-phased approach is being suggested.  This will minimize the time and    effort required to address some of the current issues and get a more viable product to market.
