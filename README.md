# TimeMaps - Online Personal Financial Literacy Software

<H3>Support and Upgrade Roadmap Overview</H3>

<p>
  TimeMaps is due for an upgrade in the architecture, technology stack and user interface for the following reasons, among others.

  <ul>
    
    • Modernize Application Architecture    
    • Application Resiliency    
    • Application Performance/Scalability
    • Data and Application Security
    • Source Code Maintainability
    • Modern coding languages for future proofing application maintenance and upgrades
    • New user-friendly interface
  
  </ul>

Implementing  [Cloud-Native](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition) and [Microservice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/) 
architectures and principles (watch video) we can achieve these objectives as well as many others.  Adopting Microsoft Azure, C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and Blazor also help address many of these concerns.
</p>

<H3>Support Plan</H3>

<p>
  Currently the application is being supported via email request.  There are no maintenance or bug issues being addressed.  Softeknology, Inc will assume ongoing responsibility supporting email requests as well as 
  any other client/customer concerns either by email or directly by phone.  Softeknology, Inc. will assume responsibility of addressing any current application bugs.
</p>

<p>
  Softeknology, Inc. will create a cloud-based source code repository for the current code base and conduct a comprehensive review of the user interface to document any current issues with the application.  Using     Azure DevOps and GitHub will achieve the following goals:

  <ul>

    • Ensure ongoing customer and application support.
    • Provide a stable application to customers.
    • Provide a secure source code repository and version control accessible from anywhere with internet access.
    • A repsoitory for documenting and backlogging any current bugs.
    • A management tool for mitigating current bugs and reporting progress of the upgrade plan.

  </ul>

  A separate project will be set up for the upgrade project to keep new source code and project backlog items separate from the existing code base.
</p>

<H3>Upgrade Plan</H3>

<p>
  Since an abundance of data and source code currently exists, as opposed to a complete re-engineering of the application all at once, a two-phased approach is being suggested.  This will minimize the time and        effort required to address some of the current issues and get a more viable product to market.
