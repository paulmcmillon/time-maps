<H3>Upgrade and Support Plan Overview</H3>

<p>
  TimeMaps is due for an upgrade in the architecture, technology stack and user interface for the following reasons, among others.

  <ul>
    
    •	Modern Application Architecture    
    •	Application Resiliency    
    •	Application Performance/Scalability
    •	Data and Application Security
    •	Source Code Maintainability
    •	Modern coding languages for future proofing application maintenance and upgrades
    •	New user-friendly interface
  
  </ul>

Implementing  Cloud-Native and Microservice architectures and principles (watch video) we can achieve these objectives as well as many others.  Adopting Microsoft Azure, C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and Blazor also help address many of these concerns.
